# ENEL 300 Final Project

## What it does:
This project is designed as a morse code intepretor implemented on an AVR microcontroller. It takes user input via a button and can recognize letters and do a unique action for each letter. 
The goal was the play an audio clip of the letter which was no feasable on the given microchip.

## What I learned:
Embbeded C - Needed to use low level C to interact with the microcontroller I had access to.

Electronics - I created an audio system to play a unique sound for each letter that I recieved from the micro controller.
